# DISCLAIMER : NEVER lose the original file that contained the string/passwords. If you do it is almost IMPOSSIBLE(Didin't try every circumstance) to recreate!
### *found it the hard way* 


# A small command line utility for turning images to string.
## for usage in passwords and other stuff.
### Written in python

### How to use:

Run the password.py with

```python3 /path-to-file/password.py```

It will ask you for a path to the image you want to convert to string.
After entering the path and running the program output will be stored inside the string.txt file.

String will be broken into 35 character long parts to not exceed the character limit.

I wouldn't recommend using big images (like 1920x1080 or something like that) since big files can cause bigger txt files and longer strings. But if you want to go for it.
